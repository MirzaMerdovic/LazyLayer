		<h1>Lazy Layer</h1>
		<p>LazyLayer is an idea of generic and reusable wrapper around Web API that would provide easier and faster
		implementation of service and data access layer.</p>
		<p>Philosophy behind it is that consumer of the layer should provide only 2 things:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Method that does a conversion of LazyLayer responses into some other specific response like IHttpActionResult of WebAPI.</li>
			<li>Method that needs to be invoked, e.g.GetUser.</li>
		</ol>
